- **TypeScript**: Provides type safety and improves code quality.
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server.
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **React Router**: Manages routing within the application.
- **React Spinners**: Provides loading indicators.
- **React Webcam**: Integrates webcam functionality.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

- Create a .env file in the root directory with your environment-specific variables.

## Usage

Development Mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts the Vite development server with hot module replacement.

Build for Production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command compiles TypeScript and builds the application for production.

Linting:

```bash
npm run lint
```

This runs ESLint to check your code for linting errors.

Preview Build:

```bash
npm run preview
```

This previews the production build locally.
